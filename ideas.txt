add life events, for example: you broke your leg... now you have to pay the hospital 6,000 dollars
add other windows, e.g minigames, which can add multiplier to your money
you are a stock broker guy, other people give you money. You need to pass quotas to get more money, and if you don't, you will be hunted down by the irs
you can only pay for life situations with your own money
game ends after 500 months
(probably slow down the game as well)
you lose game if either your personal or your investing account goes to 0.
3 tiers of personal events: 0-10k profit = events like :you found a dollar on the road. 10k-50k profit = events like: you got a bonus at work. 50k-infinite= events like: the irs audited you.


add IRS bar, in which you see a threat rating. The higher threat rating you have, the more likely the IRS is going to come and seize half your assets
if you reach 100% threat, you get arrested & game over. The way you get threat is by performing shady deals/insider trading. Your stocks don't go up as much without insider trading

once you make enough money you unlock a real estate window where you can flip houses
